Project for Catskill Mountain Maker Camp 2022 Maker Swap. Uses Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Three rheostats are used to control R-G-B levels of the neopixels so that color and brightness can be controlled. Light will be viewed through laser etched frosted acrylic showing the Catskill Mountain Maker Camp logo.
